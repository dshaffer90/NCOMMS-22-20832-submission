Code for Nature Communications submission NCOMMS-22-20832

Pre-print version: arXiv:2204.13116

Mathematica notebooks to be run on Mathematica version 12.0.0.0 

To run, execute each line sequentially 

Output produces figures in the paper 

Expected runtime: under 5 minutes

Pseudocode for both files:

1. Setup parameters
2. Set up Hamiltonain
3. Calculate eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian
4. Define functions used by the code
5. Calculate bare coupling constants from projection
6. Setup RG equations
7. Solve RG equation
8. Plot RG flow from the solutions
